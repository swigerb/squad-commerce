## Active Decisions

### 2026-03-24T12:41:48Z: Project Orchestration Directive
**By:** Brian Swiger (via Copilot)
**What:** Comprehensive architectural and operational directive for Squad-Commerce

**1. Operational Protocol:**
- All multi-step reasoning via MAF Graph-based Workflow
- No agent acts in isolation without reporting state to @ChiefSoftwareArchitect
- MCP Server tools for ERP/SQL data (GetInventoryLevels, UpdateStorePricing) — no hallucinated data, escalate errors
- A2A Handshake protocol for external vendor agents — validate external data against internal telemetry

**2. Communication Standards:**
- AG-UI protocol via MapAGUI endpoint for all streaming responses
- Status updates for UI transparency (e.g., "@TheExplorer is querying the MCP inventory server...")
- A2UI JSON payloads REQUIRED for complex data (NO raw markdown tables):
  - Inventory levels → Render: RetailStockHeatmap
  - Price changes → Render: PricingImpactChart
  - Competitor comparisons → Render: MarketComparisonGrid

**3. Enterprise Engineering Constraints:**
- OpenTelemetry tracing on every action, tool call, and agent handoff
- Structured JSON logging for all reasoning steps (Aspire Dashboard auditability)
- SignalR sidecar for background state updates to Blazor UI
- Entra ID scope enforcement — agents cannot access tools outside their claims

**4. Mission Logic:**
- "If a competitor drops prices → analyze local inventory (MCP) → verify competitor claim (A2A) → calculate margin impact → present native UI proposal (A2UI) for store manager approval/rejection"

**5. Implementation Pattern:**
- AgentPolicy enforcement in C# with EnforceA2UI, RequireTelemetryTrace, PreferredProtocol, AllowedTools
- AddAgent<ChiefSoftwareArchitect> as the orchestrator agent

**Why:** User request — captured for team memory. This is the foundational architectural directive for the entire project.

## Governance

- All meaningful changes require team consensus
- Document architectural decisions here
- Keep history focused on work, decisions focused on direction
